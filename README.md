# Person-counter-light-controller
This is a Raspberry pi Project int this project it counts persons in room and turns on or off light automatically
Open WATCHME file and have a look at connections you will have options LDR+Laser-light or Photodiode+IR-LED.
For small range eg: to show everyone should use Photodiode+IR-LED but for long doors or to use in real life use LDR+Laser-light
that is better.
